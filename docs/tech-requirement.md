This project is a game вЂњ100 matchesвЂќ, designed for two players.

Rules of the game: there are 100 matches on the table. Players take turns taking from 1 to 10 matches from the table. The one who took the last match wins.

The project is implemented as an interactive menu in a text console.
First menu item: Rules. This menu item explains the rules of the game to players.
Second menu item: New game. By selecting this menu item, players start the game process.
Third menu item: Authors. In this menu item, players can see the names and surnames of the people who took part in the creation of the project.
Fourth menu item: Exit. When this menu item is selected, the console exits.

Accepted arguments on the command line are integers. These numbers represent the number of matches that player #1 or player #2 takes.
